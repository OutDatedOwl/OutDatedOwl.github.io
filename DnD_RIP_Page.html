								Grubbles was a male druid halfing from a small village deep within the forests near Neverwinter. Discovering the Red Brands were setting up HQ at an old mansion up on a hill in Phandalin, the party decided to storm the mansion and take out the Red Brand leader. As the group rescued the Goblin, Deet, they noticed a small rat looking at them, then running off into the next room. The gang didn't think much of it but little did they know that rat was no ordinary rat. But a familiar belonging to none other than the Red Brand leader himself! Iarno Albrek, a former member of The Lord's Alliance, now the local gang leader. AKA "Glass Staff" for the glass staff he carries with him.</p> 
								<p>The gang reached Glass Staff's room. Tharralac, Nim, and Orm wanted to come up with a plan before fighting Glass Staff. Grubbles, however, thought they had the element of surprise and busted through the door first. Glass Staff, thanks to his familiar, was excepting an attack and was ready. As Grubbles knocked down the door, Glass Staff's hand radiated a purple energy. Grubble's made eye contact with Glass Staff and lept towards him. Glass Staff had finished casting <text style="color:seagreen;">Magic Missile</text> and aimed the three shots directly into Grubbles' heart, incapaciating him. The gang decided to take Glass Staff hostage before attempting to save Grubbles. Unfortunately, Grubbles' was gravely wounded and his journey came to an end in Phandalin.

								Tharralac, alongside his two Goblin companions, Deet and Leek, had decided it was best to part ways from our gang. Tharralac noticed the rest of his group beginning to settle down in Phandalin. The gang had invested in the old manor up on the hill. Tharralac was initially against the investment but didn't want to leave his friends. However, as time passed, Tharralac figured he'd head down to Candlekeep in search of more magical knowledge. Deet and Leek joined Tharralac in their journey South.</p> 
								<p>Tharralac took a small job translating texts into Dwarvish, Halfing and other languages. Tharralac occasionally brought home some books from the library and the Goblin duo, Deet and Leek, while not being able to read still flipped through the pages. After seeing the giant horses and nomadic tribes of <text style="color:seagreen;">The Shining Plains</text>. Deet asked Tharralac if they could go there and see the horses. Tharralac, instantly agreed and the trio headed down South.... far South beyond lands yet fully conquered. To the <text style="color:seagreen;">The Shining Plains</text>
