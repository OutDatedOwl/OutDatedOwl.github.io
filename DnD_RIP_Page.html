								Grubbles was a male druid halfing from a small village deep within the forests near Neverwinter. Discovering the Red Brands were setting up HQ at an old mansion up on a hill in Phandalin, the party decided to storm the mansion and take out the Red Brand leader. As the group rescued the Goblin, Deet, they noticed a small rat looking at them, then running off into the next room. The gang didn't think much of it but little did they know that rat was no ordinary rat but a familiar belonging to none other than the Red Brand leader himself! Iarno Albrek, a former member of The Lord's Alliance, now the local gang leader. Also known as "Glass Staff" for the glass staff he carries with him.</p> 
								<p>The gang reached Glass Staff's room. Tharralac, Nim, and Orm wanted to come up with a plan before fighting Glass Staff. Grubbles, however, thought they had the element of surprise and busted through the door first. Glass Staff, thanks to his familiar, was excepting an attack and was ready. As Grubbles knocked down the door, Glass Staff's hand radiated a purple energy. Grubbles made eye contact with Glass Staff and lept towards him. Glass Staff had finished casting <text style="color:mediumpurple;">Magic Missile</text> and aimed the three shots directly into Grubbles' heart, incapaciating him. The gang decided to take Glass Staff hostage before attempting to save Grubbles. Unfortunately, Grubbles' was gravely wounded and his journey came to an end in Phandalin.

								Warrick "Nim" Fiddletrick was a male gnome cleric of Leira, the goddess of illusions and lies. He's lived a long life perfecting his illusion magic to conceal his secret village hidden within the Neverwinter Woods. The gang was given a mission to check on Tibor, the brother of Harbin Wester, mayor of Phandalin. When the group arrived at Tibor's logging camp deep in the Neverwinter woods, they discovered it was destroyed by ankhegs, giant worm-like beasts. Tibor was still alive, alongside a worker, Thunk Bearbreath. While checking for supplies around the campsite, the gang triggered more ankhegs to burst through the ground and attempt to drag the gang deep beneath the ground to their dooms.</p>
								<p>Luckily, our heroes were able to fell all the ankhegs that attacked them and make it safetly out of the logging camp. However, the gang lept from the fire and into the frying pan. The Neverwinter woods is extremely dangerous, even for the likes of our heroes. Carefully, they made their way back to Phandalin, attempting to avoid any conflict as they had exhaust their spells during the fight with the ankhegs. Thunk, found a cute fire toad and decided to pick it up to show the group. The gang wasn't too fond of this and decided to throw it... but missing their target and smacking it against a rock... this action made the toad angry and a fight broke out. Nim was hit by a fireblast and collapsed to the ground. A passing Blood Hawk saw Nim on the ground and used <text style="color:indianred;">Beak</text> to tear his little Gnomish body to shreds...

Born and raised in an isolated village deep within the marshes, Ichizo garnered the respect of his community and was given the responsiblity to gather resources for his people. This allowed Ichizo to venture to the lands that border the marsh looking for work, eventually landing a job with Volo, a wealthy merchant looking for proof of an ancient civilization. Ichizo met his team at Waterdeep and they set sail for their destination</p>
								<p>Ichizo and team stumbled upon the ancient temple, unforunately falling through the floor and into the deep recesses of the dungeon. After several hours of dungeon crawling, our heroes decided to setup camp in a suspiciously safe room. Little did they know they would wake up to dozens of poisonous snakes beside them. Ichizo sprang to action, swiftly vaulting himself between his teammates and the deadly snakes. In the midst of battle, he was struck in the neck. The poison quickly pumped through Ichizo's bloodstream, stunning him for a moment while the remaining snakes swept over his body and used <text style="color:seagreen;">Bite</text> to end his life.

However, as time passed, Tharralac grew fond of adventure and decided head down to Candlekeep in search of more magical knowledge and to make some coin for the travels ahead. Deet and Leek, his two Goblin companions, joined Tharralac in his journey South.</p>

Beat has made it his mission to scour every nook and cranny of Toril. Even if that means boarding a boat to an ancient temple on an uncharted island in the middle of the sea and that is exactly what he did. Beat figured he could make some coin to fund his search for Deet. He could be anywhere! On a mountain, below the ocean, or even in way up in the sky!</p> 
								<p>Once Beat and gang found themselves amongst the evils of the temple, he quickly took to the front lines, soaking up any damage that comes his way. Beat had some close calls with death a few times. When he was webbed up in the spider caverns or during the battle with the sahuagin when sailing home. Of course, our hero made it through thick and thin with his fellow adventurers. After being paid for his labor in the mission, what would be next for Beat? His boy Deet was still missing. Beat's companion Lightwing Stormsong suggested the two look for Deet in the <text style="color:firebrick;">Undermountain</text>, an underground cavern of multiple subfloors, traps and all forms of despicable creatures. Without argument, Beat agreed and the pair were lowered beneath the Yawning Portal and into the depths below....

								Mog Mugrump, the Half-Orc Wizard, always had a knack for writing. He was to be an aspiring author, an academic! What better place for someone of the academic mind than The School of Magic. Mog could spend day and night reciting spells, reading ancient tomes, and creating his own spells. After years of study, Mog graduated with a degree in Fire Magic. Using his newly acquired skills, Mog could venture out into the world for some inspiration on his works. Eventually he would release several critically accalaimed dirty novels such as: <em>The Naughty Nymph</em>, <em>Tits 'N Bars in Mirabar</em> and of course the famous <em>Sluts in Sanctuary</em>.</p> 
								<p>Mog took up a job explore an ancient temple. With his exceptional intellect, he was able to unlock the very first door the gang came across without having to fuss about with puzzles. Despite Mog's large cranium, he strolled into a trap. A Gibbering Mouther was ready to pounce. Mog fell unconscious, almost being assimilated by the fleshy being when his friends came around to save his life. Once Mog and friends returned from their trip, Mog had wanted to chat with a girl he had a fling with, Sonya. However, Arkaeus slipped in some comments to Mog's disliking. <text style="color:lawngreen;">"<i>Arkaeus must be punished</i>"</text>. Mog decided to reveal Arkaeus as a follower of Talos to the city watch. As Arkaeus was dragged away in cuffs, Mog watched from his window, sipping his cider with a smile on his face.

With quick thinking, he dispelled himself. The group found Zolsa, who originally had bad intentions but Arkaeus' convinced her to join them in their escape of the temple. She agreed and Arkaeus had found himself a lovely lady. Returning from their adventure, Arkaeus was paid well. With his pockets stuffed with gold and a beautiful woman by his side what could go wrong? As fate would have it, Arkaeus' secret was discovered and he was promptly cuffed, booked and thrown in prison to rot. Who could have revealed Arkaeus' identity?

Once our heroes were on the ship, sailing towards Waterdeep, Erik and one of his pirate crewmates, Iggy, decided to concoct a plan. They would rob Volo of his vessel and sail off into the <text style="color:cadetblue;">Sea of Swords</text>. Under the cover of night, they did exactly that.
