								Grubbles was a male druid halfing from a small village deep within the forests near Neverwinter. Discovering the Red Brands were setting up HQ at an old mansion up on a hill in Phandalin, the party decided to storm the mansion and take out the Red Brand leader. As the group rescued the Goblin, Deet, they noticed a small rat looking at them, then running off into the next room. The gang didn't think much of it but little did they know that rat was no ordinary rat but a familiar belonging to none other than the Red Brand leader himself! Iarno Albrek, a former member of The Lord's Alliance, now the local gang leader. Also known as "Glass Staff" for the glass staff he carries with him.</p> 
								<p>The gang reached Glass Staff's room. Tharralac, Nim, and Orm wanted to come up with a plan before fighting Glass Staff. Grubbles, however, thought they had the element of surprise and busted through the door first. Glass Staff, thanks to his familiar, was excepting an attack and was ready. As Grubbles knocked down the door, Glass Staff's hand radiated a purple energy. Grubbles made eye contact with Glass Staff and lept towards him. Glass Staff had finished casting <text style="color:seagreen;">Magic Missile</text> and aimed the three shots directly into Grubbles' heart, incapaciating him. The gang decided to take Glass Staff hostage before attempting to save Grubbles. Unfortunately, Grubbles' was gravely wounded and his journey came to an end in Phandalin.

								Warrick "Nim" Fiddletrick is a male gnome cleric of Leira, the goddess of illusions and lies. He's lived a long life perfecting his illusion magic to conceal his secret village hidden within the Neverwinter Woods. The gang was given a mission to check on Tibor, the brother of Harbin Wester, mayor of Phandalin. When the group arrived at Tibor's logging camp deep in the Neverwinter woods, they discovered it was destroyed by ankhegs, giant worm-like beasts. Tibor was still alive, alongside a worker, Thunk Bearbreath. While checking for supplies around the campsite, the gang triggered more ankhegs to burst through the ground and attempt to drag the gang deep beneath the ground to their dooms.</p>
								<p>Luckily, our heroes were able to fell all the ankhegs that attacked them and make it safetly out of the logging camp. However, the gang lept from the fire and into the frying pan. The Neverwinter woods is extremely dangerous, even for the likes of our heroes. Carefully, they made their way back to Phandalin, attempting to avoid any conflict as they had exhaust their spells during the fight with the ankhegs. Thunk, found a cute fire toad and decided to pick it up to show the group. The gang wasn't too fond of this and decided to throw it... but missing their target and smacking it against a rock... this action made the toad angry and a fight broke out. Nim was hit by a fireblast and collapsed to the ground. A passing Blood Hawk saw Nim on the ground and used <text style="color:indianred;">Beak</text> to tear his little Gnomish body to shreds...

								Tharralac, alongside his two Goblin companions, Deet and Leek, had decided it was best to part ways from our gang. Tharralac noticed the rest of his group beginning to settle down in Phandalin. The gang had invested in the old manor up on the hill. Tharralac was initially against the investment but decided throw in his share of gold as he didn't want to leave his friends. However, as time passed, Tharralac grew fond of adventure and decided head down to Candlekeep in search of more magical knowledge and to make some coin for the travels ahead. Deet and Leek, his two Goblin companions, joined Tharralac in his journey South.</p> 
								<p>Tharralac took a small job at Candlekeep translating texts into Dwarvish, Halfing and other languages. Tharralac occasionally brought home some books from the library and the Goblin duo, Deet and Leek, while not being able to read still flipped through the pages. After seeing the giant horses and nomadic tribes of <text style="color:goldenrod;">The Shining Plains</text>. Deet asked Tharralac if they could go there and ride the giant horses. Leek looked at Deet then at Tharralac with a big smile and nodded with excitement. Tharralac, instantly agreed as he once again yearned for adventure and the trio headed down South.... far South beyond lands yet fully conquered.
