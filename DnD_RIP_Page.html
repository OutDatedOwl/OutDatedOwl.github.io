								Grubbles was a male druid halfing from a small village deep within the forests near Neverwinter. Discovering the Red Brands were setting up HQ at an old mansion up on the hill, the party decided to storm the mansion and take out the Red Brand leader. As the group rescued the Goblin, Deet, they noticed a small rat looking at them, then running off into the next room. The gang didn't think much of it but little did they know that rat was no ordinary rat. But a familiar belonging to none other than the Red Brand leader himself! Iarno Albrek, a former member of The Lord's Alliance, now the local gang leader. AKA "Glass Staff" for the glass staff he carries with him.</p> 
								<p>The gang reached Glass Staff's room. The party wanted to come up with a plan before fighting Glass Staff. Grubbles, however, thought they had the element of surprise and busted through the door first. Glass Staff, thanks to his familiar, was excepting an attack and was ready. As Grubbles knocked down the door, Glass Staff's hand radiated a purple energy. Grubble's made eye contact with Glass Staff and lept towards him. Unfortantely, Glass Staff had finished casting <text style="color:seagreen;">Magic Missile</text> and aimed the three shots directly into Grubbles' heart, incapaciating him. The gang, in combat with Glass Staff, decided to neutralize the threat before attempting to save Grubbles. Unfortunately, Grubbles' was gravely wounded and his journey came to an end in Phandalin.
