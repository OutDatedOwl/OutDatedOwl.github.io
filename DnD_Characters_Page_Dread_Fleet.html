									Finn is a male Half-Elf rogue. He claims to have come from all over, and keeps details about his past close to the chest. He is a very charming man, the type who prefers to use words over blades when it comes to conflict.
								</p>
								<p>
									For reasons kept to himself, he responds to a flier posted in the city of Waterdeep, looking to hire adventurers to handle all kinds of dangerous tasks that one might run into out on the Sea of Swords. With his motivations kept secret, Finn heads out to The Yawning Portal, to meet his new captain, Grakka.

								Fronto Nimblefoot the 33rd is Halfing Barbarian. He was born in Athkatla to a traveling group of merchants and circus performers. They worshipped Waukeen and traveled all over Amn, selling their wares and entertaining guests. His father was a strongman and his mother an acrobat. At age 2, Fronto's father Fronto the 32nd caught the boy curling his 100 lb dumbbells.
								Immediately Bronto knew Fronto was destined to be the circus's next Strong-man. He would grow up lifting during the day and tending to the circus animals at night.
							</p>
							<p>
								One night, his mother Fronta walked in on Fronto telling jokes to the lion den. Fronto was blessed with the ability to speak with animals. With his unique gifts, business boomed. Until a spike in crime plagued the roads of Amn. Highwaymen and Orcs lurked about. Travel was dangerous. Business waned. As the circus bled money, Fronto suggested a solution. 
								He become and adventurer to help pay for the circus costs. 
								With word of finding work at The Yawning Portal, far from home in Waterdeep, Fronto quickly made his way North.
